# Capstone
Included here is my 2021 Washington & Jefferson College Physics Capstone.
A semester long literature review was done on a selected advancing field in Physics. For my capstone project I chose to look at optical tweezers and how they are used in single molecular biophysics, more specifically on testing the elastic properties of B-DNA.
To convey my understanding of the material, a 5 page review style article was written in LaTeX and a 20 minute presentation was given to faculty and students attending.
